# Feature requests / Issues
This plugin was mainly designed for my usage/usecases, please control the desire to request X feature since other than what I have stated here I don't
intend to do a bunch more. If it does not work for you I also do not intend to provide customer support so please try and solve any configuration issues yourself.
Please do not raise issues like `How do I do X?`.

If you have an idea you would like to contribute please raise a PR ðŸ¥‡.
